# ROKU FLASHBACK STREAMING APP
## Authoring 4 - Team Build
Roku Flashback is an streaming app designed to display movies, tv shows and music from the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. It has different functionalities such as profiles that filter the content depending on the users age. 

## Description

The project required two rolls: graphic designer and web developer. Some of the sofware used includes WAMP stack (such as MySQL and PHP), Vue.js as the main framework for JS, among others.

The Designer role was to design the look and feel of a mobile-first web application based on the supplied brief (Roku
Flashback) using interactive elements, including what might be required in terms of Single Page Applications
(SPA), hybrid multipage applications, and data transactions (preloaders, microtransactions,
flash messaging etc).

The Developer role was to create the proper project stucture, create and use database assets and research and implement how to include social media APIs (Facebook, Twitter, etc) to like, share, and comment / rate on each of the individual multimedia selections.
